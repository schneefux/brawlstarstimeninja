There are various websites and YouTube tutorials promising free Gems, free Skins or free Coins.
Unfortunately, it is not that easy.

Most of the time, you will be redirected to a website that wants "verification".
You are supposed to enter your phone number, email or you need to download an app.

Don't fall for this scam!
Never share private data with a website that promises to give you something for free that you normally pay for.

There is no Brawl Stars Gem generator.
Brawl Stars has good protection against hacks and cheats.

After entering your data into "hacking" sites, you will receive annoying emails.
If you give away your Brawl Stars account, it will be sold and you lose access to it.
Or worse: By sending text messages to premium numbers, you will be charged real money.

If you want to get a free skin, check on the [official Brawl Stars blog](https://blog.brawlstars.com/blog/community/) whether a giveaway is happening.
It is the only trustable source for free Brawl Stars content.

Always check who is trying to give you free Gems or Skins.
If you are not sure, send a message to Supercell.
You can contact them from the settings screen in the app.

Stay safe!
