description: "Dynamike is a squishy thrower with $health HP. He throws two
  sticks of dynamite for his main attack and a whole barrel of dynamite for his
  super. Brawler fact: Dynamike dislikes the auto-aim feature, so don't use it
  unless you want to make Mike VERY UPSET ‘(T∩T)’."
main: "Boom! Dynamike throws out two sticks of dynamite, each dealing $damage
  damage. His attack can go over walls and has a range of $range tiles. The
  farther away Mike throws his sticks, the faster they explode. The sticks'
  spread also increases the farther away they are thrown. As the sticks take
  time to explode after landing, it is better to throw it at where the enemy is
  going to go rather than where they were. Each stick of dynamite landed on a
  brawler charges Mike's super up by 25% for a maximum of 50% per attack on a
  single enemy. In other words, Mike's super can be charged up by 2-4 attacks. "
super: KABOOM! Dynamike lobs a whole barrel of dynamite at his enemies, dealing
  $damage damage and blowing up cover while also knocking surviving enemies
  back. His super has a bigger spread than his main attack and it charges up his
  next super by 50% per brawler hit. This means that landing a super on two+
  brawlers at once will give Mike the next super back immediately, making
  Dynamike one of the fastest brawlers to charge their supers. In fact, even if
  Mike only hit one brawler, he can gain his next super back within 1-2
  successful attacks. Because of how frequently Mike gets his super, it is
  recommended to use it as soon as possible and not save it like Tara's super.
  Because Mike's super can break cover, it can be used to open up space for
  long-ranged brawlers to attack along with reducing the effectiveness of enemy
  throwers. Just make sure you don't blow up your own walls.
