name: Dynamike
gender: null
description: "Dynamike is a squishy thrower with $health HP. He throws two
  sticks of dynamite for his main attack and a whole barrel of dynamite for his
  super. Brawler fact: Dynamike dislikes the auto-aim feature, so don't use it
  unless you want to make Mike VERY UPSET ‘(T∩T)’."
main: Boom! Dynamike throws out two sticks of dynamite, each dealing $damage
  damage. His attack can go over walls and has a range of $range tiles. The
  farther away Mike throws his sticks, the faster they explode. The sticks'
  spread also increases the farther away they are thrown. As the sticks take
  time to explode after landing, it is better to throw it at where the enemy is
  going to go rather than where they were.
super: "KABOOM! Dynamike sends his opponents a whole barrel of dynamite, dealing
  $damage damage and blowing up cover while also knocking surviving enemies
  back. "
