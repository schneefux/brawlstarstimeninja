name: Dynamike
gender: null
description: "Dynamike is a squishy thrower with $health HP. He throws two
  sticks of dynamite for his main attack and a whole barrel of dynamite for his
  super. Fun fact: Dynamike dislikes the auto-aim feature, so don't use it
  unless you want to make Mike VERY UPSET ‘(T∩T)’."
main: Boom! Dynamike throws out two sticks of dynamite, each dealing $damage
  damage. His attack can go over walls and has a range of $range tiles. The
  farther away Mike throws his sticks, the faster they explode. The sticks'
  spread also increases the farther away they are thrown.
