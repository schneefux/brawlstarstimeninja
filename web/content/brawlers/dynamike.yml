    description: "Arguably the hardest mechanic to master in the game, Dyna-jump
      allows for Dynamike to jump over obstacles and into the air from his
      dynamites. This allows Mike to be able to avoid attacks/supers, retreat
      behind a wall, and taking shortcuts over walls to reach an objective
      faster. The distance that Mike is propelled is different between his main
      attack and super, with the super propelling Mike forwards more. "
gadget1_description: Dynamike spins around and throws sticks of dynamite around
  himself while also gaining a speed boost. Each stick of dynamite deals
  $damage, and because of its inconsistencies, best used to finish a brawler
  off. The increased movement speed allows Mike to get away from enemies and
  inversely, get back in action or another destination such as the goal faster.
  Aside from being used as a finisher and a speed boost, Fidget Spinner can also
  be used for area denial.
gadget2_description: The next regular attack will stun enemies in place for 1.5
  seconds if landed successfully. Satchel Charge allows for Dynamike and his
  team to take down most enemies and win the lane advantage, turning the fight
  to a 3v2, 3v1, or even a 3v0. Mike's 2nd gadget also works on the IKE turret
  and siege bot, making him and his team able to deal more damage to the IKE or
  the siege bot respectively. In addition, the stun from Satchel Charge can
  knock the ball out of enemy brawlers' hand, interrupt an enemies' super, and
  so much more!

      dynamite around himself, each dealing 1200 damage. While using Fidget
      Spinner, Dynamike is not able to use his main attack or super. His gadget
      can be used to check bushes, head back into battle/to an objective faster,
      area denial, finishing off enemies, and getting away from enemies. "

      brawlers can tell that you have a stun prepared from the halo on your head
      after activating the gadget. Satchel Charge can be used to gain his super,
      interrupt a brawler's super, temporarily halting the siege bot, forcing
      opponents back and making them be on guard, making brawlers take
      guaranteed damage from minecarts, meteors, etc., and gaining the lane
      advantage early on as stunned brawlers are likely to die. "

description: "Dynamike is a thrower with $health HP. He throws two sticks of
  dynamite for his main attack and a whole barrel of dynamite that can destroy
  cover and knock back brawlers for his super. Brawler Fact: Dynamike dislikes
  the auto-aim button, so don't use it unless you want to make him very upset
  (Tâˆ©T)."
main: "Boom! Dynamike throws out two sticks of dynamite, each dealing $damage
  damage. His attack can go over walls and has a range of $range tiles. The
  farther away Mike throws his sticks, the faster they explode and the wider
  their spread. As the sticks take time to explode after landing, it is better
  to stay back and throw it at where the enemy is going to go rather than where
  they are. Each stick of dynamite landed on a brawler charges Mike's super up
  by 25% for a maximum of 50% per attack on a single enemy. In other words,
  Mike's super can be charged up by 2-4 attacks. "
super: "KABOOM! Dynamike lobs a whole barrel of dynamite at his enemies, dealing
  $damage damage. It blows up cover and also knocks surviving enemies back. His
  super has a bigger spread than his main attack and it charges up his next
  super by 50% per brawler hit. This means that landing a super on two or more
  brawlers at once will make Mike regain his next super back immediately, making
  him one of the fastest brawlers capable of charging their supers. In fact,
  even if Mike only hits one brawler with his super, he can gain his super back
  within 1-2 successful attacks. Because of how frequently Mike gets his super,
  it is recommended to use it as soon as possible and not save it. The super
  doesn't have to be used on a brawler either, as breaking walls can also be
  beneficial. Some benefits of destroying covers includes: more control for long
  ranged brawlers, decreasing the amount of walls that enemy throwers can hide
  behind, opening up spaces for an easier goal in Brawl Ball, and opening up a
  shortcut for the siege bot. Just make sure to not destroy your own walls."
