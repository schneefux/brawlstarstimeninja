Jessie's tankiness and chained attack makes her a great mid player. She also has good turret spots.
Pam can be played mid well if lane is held by her two teammates. Her survivability is excellent which allows her to stay in the center longer.

### Alternative to Carl

Primo is tanky enough where he can take some damage and still be a threat, pushing enemies back.

Initial Setup
---

Positioned behind the walls north to the mine, Frank can annoy the enemy and make it very hard for them to push up.

One of the lane players can help mid control the entry area to the mine by using their attacks there. This is where the enemy will attack mid from.

Destroying the walls north to the mine will work both ways. It'll make mid much more open therefore harder for Frank to hold.

Rico needs to shoot down the lane at thea east to clear out any potential threats. It's important to hold at least one lane so mid does not get completely flanked.

Rico and Carl can clear out enemies hiding in the corners on the side of the mine.

Carl needs to shoot down the east lane to clear out any potential threats. It's important to hold at leas one lane so mid does not get completely flanked.

It's important that mid is never flanked. If a lane is lost, mid must be extremely careful of the area south of the mine. A good flank by the enemy can turn the entire game around!

Sometimes the enemy will "double up" on mid. This means that one lane will be free. The free lane player should either help with their attacks from the side, or go and flank mid from behind.

**When a teammate dies, reposition to try to hold as much map presence for as long as possible.**
